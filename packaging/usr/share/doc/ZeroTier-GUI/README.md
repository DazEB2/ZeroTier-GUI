# Installation

You can download the software from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/zerotier-gui-git/).

    paru -Syu zerotier-gui-git

If you are in an Ubuntu/Debian based distribution, you can download the source code and run the `make_deb.sh` script.

    ZeroTier-GUI$ cd packaging
    ZeroTier-GUI$ ./make_deb.sh

You may need to mark it as executable first:

    chmod +x make_deb.sh

**The script must be ran on the `packaging` folder, make sure to `cd` into it.**

The script will generate a `ZeroTier-GUI.deb` package in the root directory. Simply install it with `dpkg -i Zerotier-GUI.deb`. You may need to run `apt -f install` afterwards to install dependencies if unmet.

# Dependencies

None of the packages contains the back-end, zerotier-one. Arch has it in the `community` repo. For Ubuntu based distributions, you'll need to install it manually [from their website](https://www.zerotier.com/download/). On top of that, you'll need python3.6 or greater, and the tkinter module. This however should be handled by the packaging software.
